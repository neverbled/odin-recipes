                    <p>Now that we've discussed the ingredients
                        we can continue toward how to make the omelette step by step.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the filling. <em>You can choose between a vegeterian or bacon omelette.</em>

                    <br><br>

                    <ul><li>Vegeterian Omelette:
                            To make a veggie omelette, dice 1 cup of your preferred vegetables.

                        <br>Then, over medium-high heat, saut√© the vegetables and garlic in olive oil unitl soft,
                    about 3-5 minutes<br>
                    depending on the vegetables you choose.</li></ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul><li>Bacon Omelette:
                            To make a bacon omelette, begin by cooking the bacon, garlic and onion over
                            medium<br>heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes).</li></ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Cook the omelette. Once the fillings are ready, it's time to <strong>cook</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Begin by whisking the eggs until they are homogenous. You want to
                        beat those eggs until there are no pieces of<br>white separated from the yolks.
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Then, whisk in the salt and pepper.
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Next, melt the butter in an eight inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Then, add the whisked eggs and swirl them in the pan until they 
                        are evenly distributed.
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs
                        begin to set. <em>Don't rush the process.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push
                        the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any<br>uncooked eggs on top pour over the sides 
                        to the egdes of the pan and cook. Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.
                        <ul><li><em>you're almost there!</em></li></ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Sprinkle the cheese over the omelette and add the toppings on one half<br>
                        of the omelette, then gently fold the other half over the toppings.
                    <br><br>
                    <li><em><strong>Serve!</strong></em>
